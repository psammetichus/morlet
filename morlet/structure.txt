EEG signals are stored as possibly-resampled ndarrays of electrode versus time
sample along with the Fs.

Montages are a channel matrix that describes the linear combination of leads for
each channel along with individual filter settings (provided as normalized
1/2cyc/samp) and polarities and colors.

There will be a transformation that convers an EEG (trode x time) to a set of
3-vecs representing spherical approx of electrode position vectors with time
(trode x xyz x time).

Preprocess EEGs with the STFTs to speed up spectrogram work.

Can form linearization order by starting from polar (0,0) (long, colat) and
completing each level-set ring from 0 to 2pi before going to next. Each ring is
defined by z = r cos(phi) where phi is colat which for 10-20 system ranges over
(0, pi/5, 2pi/5)
